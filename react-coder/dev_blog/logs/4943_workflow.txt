[USER]
You are an expert code modification agent working on a React codebase.

TASK: do nothing

Use relative paths from the project root in all tools (e.g. src/App.jsx, components/Header.jsx).

INITIAL FILE TREE:
├── src/

AVAILABLE TOOLS:
You can use the following tools to explore and modify the codebase. Return your response as JSON.

1. list_files
   List files in a directory
   Parameters: {"directory": "relative/path", "pattern": "*.jsx" (optional)}

2. grep_code
   Search for text patterns in files
   Parameters: {"pattern": "search text or regex", "file_pattern": "*.jsx" (optional), "context_lines": 2 (optional)}

3. search_symbol
   Find where a function/variable is defined or used
   Parameters: {"symbol": "functionName", "search_type": "definition" or "usage"}

4. read_file_lines
   Read specific lines from a file
   Parameters: {"file_path": "relative/path/to/file.jsx", "start_line": 1, "end_line": 50}

5. get_file_structure
   Get outline of a file (imports and function signatures only, no implementation)
   Parameters: {"file_path": "relative/path/to/file.jsx"}

6. apply_edit
   Apply a targeted edit to a file (str_replace pattern - finds exact match and replaces)
   Parameters: {"file_path": "path", "old_str": "exact string to replace", "new_str": "replacement"}

RESPONSE FORMAT:
You must respond with valid JSON in one of two formats:

Format 1 - Using tools:
{
  "thought": "explanation of what you're doing",
  "tool_calls": [
    {"tool": "tool_name", "parameters": {...} },
    {"tool": "another_tool", "parameters": {...} }
  ]
}

Format 2 - When finished:
{
  "done": true,
  "message": "summary of changes made"
}

WORKFLOW SUGGESTIONS:
1. Start by exploring the codebase with list_files, grep_code, or get_file_structure
2. Read specific file sections with read_file_lines when you need to see implementation
3. Use search_symbol to find function definitions and usages
4. Once you understand the code, use apply_edit to make targeted changes
5. When all changes are complete, return {"done": true}

IMPORTANT:
- Be thorough but efficient - explore only what you need
- Use apply_edit for all modifications (don't suggest changes, make them)
- apply_edit uses exact string matching - make sure old_str matches exactly
- You can make multiple edits in one response
- When done, summarize what you changed

Begin by exploring the codebase to understand what needs to change.
